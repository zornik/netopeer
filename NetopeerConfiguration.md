_This configuration is used in the **ssh\_tls** netopeer branch._

# Model #

The netopeer-cfgnetopeer model can be found in _netopeer/server/config/netopeer-cfgnetopeer.yang_. In this model there are several general server options and then one SSH-exclusive container and one TLS-exclusive one. They can be used only when netopeer is compiled with the support for the particular transport protocol. Every node includes a description, which should be read before trying to understand the following example configuration.

## General settings ##

  * _hello-timeout_ - The number of seconds the server will wait for the hello message upon accepting a new connection before dropping the client.
  * _idle-timeout_ - Maximum number of seconds a client does not need to send any data before it is dropped. Client with active notification subscription will never be dropped this way.
  * _max-sessions_ - Maximum number of simultaneous sessions the server will create. After reaching this limit every new connection is immediately dropped.
  * _response-time_ - The number of miliseconds every request will usually be responded to. Lower values will increase CPU utilization, higher values the response time.
  * _client-removal-time_ - Additional number of miliseconds a request response may be postponed. At most this long will be waited for a lock needed for removing clients.

## SSH ##

  * _server-keys_ - Paths to private keys whose public counterpart will be used by clients for server verification.
  * _client-auth-key_ - If the public key presented by a client will match the one found in the path, the client must use username to pass authentication.
  * _password-auth-enabled_ - If enabled, the "password" authentication method will be advertised by the server as supported. If a client uses it, the presented username and password will be searched for a match in the locally-configured authentication method. These are usually entries found in "/etc/passwd" and "/etc/shadow".
  * _auth-attempts_ - Number of attempts a client has to successfully authenticate. The client is disconnected after reaching this limit.
  * _auth-timeout_ - Number of seconds the server will wait for the client to authenticate. Unauthenticated client connected for this long is disconnected.

## TLS ##

  * _server-cert_ - The certificate that the server sends to clients during TLS verification.
  * _server-key_ - The private key matching the server certificate.
  * _trusted-ca-cert_ - This certificate is marked as trusted and so are any certificates signed by this Certificate Authority. The certificates from the server certificate trusted CA chain must be trusted.
  * _trusted-client-cert_ - This certificate is marked as trusted and so is any client that presents this certificate as their own.
  * _crl-dir_ - The directory containing Certificate Revocation Lists of the trusted Certificate Authorities.
  * _cert-to-name_ - If the fingerprint of any certificate from a client certificate chain matches this fingerprint, this cert-to-name entry is considered a match. After that, based on the map-type value the server tries to assign a NETCONF username to this client.

## transAPI modules ##

  * _module_ - The module with name is either enabled or disabled.
